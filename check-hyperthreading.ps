# Purpose: Helps identify the number of physical processors, logical processors and hyperthreading on the server.

# Provide the computer information

# Get the Processor information from the WMI object

$vProcessors = [object[]]$(get-WMIObject Win32_Processor -ComputerName $vComputerName)

# To account for older machines

# If the necessary hotfixes are installed as mentioned below, then the NumberOfCores and NumberOfLogicalProcessors can be fetched correctly

# For Windows Server 2003, KB932370 needs to be installed

# For Windows XP, KB936235 needs to be installed
